# EveLLM
EveLLM is a family of large language models (LLMs) derived from AdamLLM (repository available [here](https://github.com/ElliotLeeLL/AdamLLM)). We are currently migrating the EveLLM architecture from GPT to LLaMA. The EveLLM family currently includes two models: **EveLLM Classifier**, designed for film review classification tasks, and **EveLLM Chat**, tailored for instruction-following tasks.

## EveLLM Classifier

EveLLM Classifier is a fine-tuned LLM based on GPT2-355M, and it is updated for classification tasks. The architecture is shown in the Figure below:
